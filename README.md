## Analysis Pipeline (Experimental)

An experimental Python-based pipeline showcases data ingestion from Binance, simple feature engineering, a naive sentiment analyzer and a basic backtesting engine. Run the example to see a full workflow:

```bash
python -m analysis.example_pipeline
```

This is a starting point for integrating alternative data sources and advanced analytics into the trading stack. A lightweight
Solana RPC helper rotates across endpoints from providers such as Helius, QuickNode or public RPC nodes and falls back to
offline defaults if none respond.

The pipeline now also includes Bollinger Bands, MACD calculations and a simple volatility regime detector that adapts moving
average windows per regime for extra edge during backtests. A lightweight wallet
analysis helper fetches transaction histories, aggregates token interactions and
surfaces repeating patterns so KOL or insider wallets can be monitored for early
signals.

Recent enhancements showcase additional data dimensions for competitive edge:

- trade-based metrics such as Fibonacci retracements, cumulative volume delta and
  market-cap estimates via circulating supply fetches
- holder concentration summaries to spot whale dominance or distribution trends
- social-data aggregation across Twitter, Telegram, GitHub and news snippets to
  extract trending tokens or narratives
- wallet performance classification and ranking to highlight top traders versus
  underperformers
- KOL wallet scanner combining their recurring token patterns with social
  trends to surface mimic signals
- statistical price anomaly detection using z-scores to flag unusual moves
- topic extraction on aggregated social posts to surface emergent narratives
- grid-search optimizer that tunes regime-specific moving-average windows and
  reports metrics like Sharpe ratio, max drawdown and win rate for deeper
  backtest evaluations
- walk-forward analyzer that repeatedly optimizes SMA windows on rolling
  training sets and evaluates the best parameter out-of-sample for more robust
  backtests
- JSON cache for OHLCV and trade requests, enabling instant offline reuse of
  previously fetched market data
- cross-correlation analysis to spot leading relationships between price
  returns and social sentiment
- Hurst exponent calculation to gauge trend persistence versus
  mean-reversion

Run the example pipeline to see these analytics combined into a single flow.
